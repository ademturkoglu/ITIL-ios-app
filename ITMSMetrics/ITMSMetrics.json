        "goal": "The average cost of a technology resource. This metric provides a good view of how well managers are controlling costs by using cheaper outsourcing labor, being thoughtful in the use of higher priced temporary labor and managing an organization that is not top heavy with expensive employees (discussed in more detail in the Supplemental Financial Metrics section). Some organizations set targets for outsourcing (e.g., 30 percent of the workforce), but I think the overall resource cost metric is much more powerful. If managers believe they can be more productive and keep costs down using a variety of techniques, why not let them rather than focus on a single strategy?"

        "goal": "There are several other metrics that can be useful for organizations. Simply keeping a running total of the dollars saved from cost initiatives (e.g., moving to cheaper technologies) can help keep the focus on these projects. Tracking costs by activity (e.g., development versus maintenance versus running the systems versus other costs) can highlight areas for improvement."
